## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

*run_analysis.R* is an R language script that will use Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset described in the CodeBook.md and generate a tidydata.csv file.

The run_analysis.R script was tested with R version 3.1.0.  The data for the script needs to be in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset".  Also, the dataset directory needs to be in the same directory as the R script.

To run the script set your working directory in R to the directory containing the "run_analysis.R" script and type:

    source("run_analysis.R") 

from within R.
